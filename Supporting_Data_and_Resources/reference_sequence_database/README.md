## 📁 Custom regional 12S MiFish Reference Sequence Database

**File:** `12S_MiFish_custom_RDB_PutahCK.txt`

This file contains a 12S rRNA gene reference sequence database for the species assemblage of the San Francisco Estuary and Putah Creek (California, US) and used for taxonomic assignment in *Spatiotemporal stability of fish communities in a regulated stream: Insights from environmental DNA*. The reference sequences have been trimmed to the MiFish 12S barcode region (~170 bp) to match the target amplicon of the study.

## 🔍 Source and attribution

This reference sequence database is **modified from**:

> **Nagarajan, R., Holmes, A., & Schreier, A. (2023).**  
> This curated resource includes both sequences originally generated by the authors (now publicly available on GenBank) and additional reference sequences sourced from GenBank.
 
### 🛠 Modifications to this version include:
• Addition of non-target taxa not expected in Putah Creek to faciliate quality filtering
• Standardization of species names and sequence dereplication 
• Format adjustments for compatibility with DADA2’s `assignTaxonomy()` function
