**_Spatiotemporal stability of fish communities in a regulated stream: Insights from environmental DNA_**.

This is a community ecology study of freshwater fishes in in Putah Creek (California, US), a remnant habitat for formerly abundant native freshwater and anadromous fishes ([Moyle et al. 1998](https://doi.org/10.1577/1548-8446(1998)023%3C0006:FHADJF%3E2.0.CO;2)) and model system for stream restoration ([Kiernan et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1890/11-0480.1); [Jacinto et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2868)). The objectives of this study are to (1) elucidate spatiotemporal trends in fish assemblages along the longitudinal profile of a stream where flows are managed to benefit native anadromous fishes; (2) compare eDNA results with long-term standardized monitoring techniques at a subset of sites; and (3) assess how eDNA might be used to inform stream management. This work demonstrates the value of eDNA as a complement to conventional sampling for understanding community assembly dynamics in streams, including responses to ecosystem rehabilitation and flow management.
