# 🧬 🐟 Spatiotemporal Stability of Fish Communities in a Regulated Stream: Insights from Environmental DNA

This repository contains R scripts, figures, metadata, resources and processed data supporting the manuscript:  
**_Spatiotemporal stability of fish communities in a regulated stream: Insights from environmental DNA_**.

This study applied eDNA metabarcoding to (1) elucidate spatiotemporal trends in fish assemblages along the longitudinal profile of a stream where flows are managed to benefit native anadromous fishes; (2) compare eDNA results with long-term standardized monitoring techniques at a subset of sites; and (3) assess how eDNA might be used to inform stream management. This work demonstrates the value of eDNA as a complement to conventional sampling for understanding community assembly dynamics in streams, including responses to stream rehabilitation and ecosystem management.
