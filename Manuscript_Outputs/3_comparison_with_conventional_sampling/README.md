# Comparison with Conventional Sampling

Figures comparing fish community sampling results using eDNA with results using electrofishing and traps.

### ðŸ”Ž Figure 4. Alluvial plots comparing detection using eDNA and conventional methods.

Plots show comparisions of relative abundace of eDNA reads, individuals detected, and, when available, biomass. 

### ðŸ”Ž Supplementary Figure S3. Venn diagrams comparing detection using eDNA and conventional methods.

Presence/absence of fish species using eDNA and conventional sampling.
