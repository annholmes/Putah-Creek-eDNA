# Community and Spatiotemporal Dynamics

Figures, Tables, and Supplementary Files related to fish community sampling results and spatiotemporal dynamics using eDNA.

## Fish community

### 🐟 Table 2. Fish species detected by family

This table shows species detected (presence/absence) compared with historical records.

📌 Note: Historical data can be found in:

Jacinto, E., Fangue, N. A., Cocherell, D. E., Kiernan, J. D., Moyle, P. B., & Rypel, A. L. (2023). *Increasing stability of a native freshwater fish assemblage following flow rehabilitation*. *Ecological Applications*, 33(5), e2868. https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2868

### 🐟 Figure 2. Fish species detected by site and phlyogenetic relationship

This table shows species detected (presence/absence) by site and shows the phylogenetic relationships.

📌 Note: Phylogenetic relationships based on the MiFish marker may not reflect true phylogenetic relationships due to limited phylogenetic signal and other factors that can create gene tree discordance (e.g., incomplete lineage sorting, hybridization, genetic introgression, and rapid speciation events). 

### 🐟 Supplementary Figure S2. Relative read abundance of fish species detected by site and data of collection

Bar plots of fish communities showing relative red abundance.

📌 Note: Relative read abundance may not reflect actual species or biomass relative abundance.

## Spatiotemporal dynamics

### 🧬 Figure 3. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plot

NMDS plot based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.
