# Manuscript Outputs Folder

This folder contains draft figures, tables, and supplementary files for *Spatiotemporal stability of fish communities in a regulated stream: Insights from environmental DNA*.

## Subfolders

### 📝 `1_sites_and_sequencing/`
  Sampling site metadata, sequencing summaries, and diversity metrics (e.g., richness, Shannon diversity).

### 📊 `2_community_and_spatiotemporal_dynamics/`
  Community composition, NMDS ordination, and PERMANOVA analyses.

### 🎣 `3_comparison_with_conventional_sampling/`
  Comparisons eDNA and conventional fish sampling results.

### 📉 `4_reordering_and_species-specific_responses/`
  Gradient forest model, rank abundance curves (Whittaker plots) and exploratory mean rank shift.

### 🐟 Figure 2. Detection of fish species
Presence/absense of historically occurring fish species in eDNA metabarcoding data with phylogenetic tree showing relatedness at the MiFish barcode.

### 📊 Figure 3.
Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plot of eDNA samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

### 📉 Figure 4. 
Modified rank abundance curves for eDNA sequencing data.

### 🏆 Figure 5.
Performance of fish species in gradient forest model. High performing species had >0.50 R2 importance following a broken stick model. Three species lacked sufficient data for the model.
