### 🐟 Figure 2. Detection of fish species
Presence/absense of historically occurring fish species in eDNA metabarcoding data with phylogenetic tree showing relatedness at the MiFish barcode.

### 📊 Figure 3.
Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plot of eDNA samples based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity.

### 📉 Figure 4. 
Modified rank abundance curves for eDNA sequencing data.

### 🏆 Figure 5.
Performance of fish species in gradient forest model. High performing species had >0.50 R2 importance following a broken stick model. Three species lacked sufficient data for the model.
