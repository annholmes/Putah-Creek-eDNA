# Reordering and Species Responses

Figures and explanatory analysis showing reordering, dominance, and response to spatial and seasonal gradients.

## Reordering

### ðŸ“‰ Figure 5. Rank abundance curves (Whittaker plots).

Species ranked by relative abundance (eDNA index) by collecting event. 

### ðŸ“‰ Supplementary Figure S3. Exploratory mean rank shift (MRS) values.

Exploratory analysis using MRS values for community composition comparisons at select sites. Values are only available for sites that were sampled multiple years or seasons. Higher values indicate greater temporal turnover. 

ðŸ“Œ Note: MRS comparisons are exploratory and do not include significance testing.

## Species responses

### ðŸ”„ Figure 6. Gradient Forest Model species

Species-specific responses to environmental gradient (longitudinal position i.e., river km) and year, modeled using Gradient Forest. Significance was assessed using a broken stick model.

ðŸ“Œ Note: The model automatically excludes species with insufficient data to model reliable responses (typically rarely detected species).

### ðŸ”„ Supplementary Table S3. Gradient Forest Model importance

Gradient Forest importance metrics provided in the supplement.
