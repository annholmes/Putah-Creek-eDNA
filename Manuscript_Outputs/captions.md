## Table 1
**Table 1.** Sites in Lower Putah Creek (Solano and Yolo Counties, California) sampled for environmental DNA (eDNA) from 2019–2021, including a subset with concurrent conventional surveys.

*Footnote:* Multiple methods indicates combined electrofishing, traps, gill nets, and beach seine sampling.

## Table 2

**Table 2.** Fish species detected in Putah Creek (2019–2021) using environmental DNA metabarcoding, with presence also noted from concurrent (2020–2021) and long-term (1993–2017) conventional surveys; native species indicated by unshaded boxes.

*Footnote:* See Jacinto et al. 2023 and Hitt et al. 2025 for detailed descriptions of conventional sampling methods.

# Supplementary materials:

## Table 
**Supplementary Table.** Metabarcoding results and diversity indices of eDNA samples (n=58) collected in 21 sampling events of Putah Creek. All fish sequences were matched to species and species-level identifications were used to compute the diversity indices. Site codes and metadata are shown in Table 1.
