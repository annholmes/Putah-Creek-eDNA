## Table 1
**Table 1.** Sites in Lower Putah Creek (Solano and Yolo Counties, California) sampled for environmental DNA (eDNA) from 2019–2021, including a subset with concurrent conventional surveys.

*Footnote:* Multiple methods indicates combined electrofishing, traps, gill nets, and beach seine sampling.

## Table 2
**Table 2.** Fish species detected in Putah Creek (2019–2021) using environmental DNA metabarcoding, with presence also noted from concurrent (2020–2021) and long-term (1993–2017) conventional surveys; native species indicated by unshaded boxes.

*Footnote:* See Jacinto et al. 2023 and Hitt et al. 2025 for detailed descriptions of conventional sampling methods.

## Tables
**Supplementary Table.** Metabarcoding results and diversity indices of eDNA samples (n=58) collected in 21 sampling events of Putah Creek. All fish sequences were matched to species and species-level identifications were used to compute the diversity indices. Site codes and metadata are shown in Table 

## Figures
**Supplementary Figure.** Species accumulation curves for environmental DNA (eDNA) samples (n = 58) collected from Putah Creek. Sequencing depth was generally sufficient to capture fish species richness present in each sample. Colors are used to distinguish individual samples and do not represent other variables.
